# Definition
Language is **regular** if some [[Theory of Computation/Introduction#Definite Finite Automata |Definite Finite Automata]] exists that accepts the string.

### Examples
For the ![[Drawing 2023-03-22 00.25.34.excalidraw]] we saw it in [[Theory of Computation/Introduction |Introduction]] 
$L(M) = \{w \, | \,w\,\text{contains sub-string 11}\} = A$

As we can see that $M$ exist which accepts $A$
$\therefore \, A \, \text{is regular}$  

$B \, = \, \{w \,| \, \text{has even number of }1's \}$  is Regular 
$C = \{w \,| \, \text{has equal number of } 0's\,\text{and}\, 1's \}$ is *NOT* regular
$D = \{ w \, | \, \text{w is a string that has 001 as a substring} \}$ is Regular

P.S $C$ is DCFL.
