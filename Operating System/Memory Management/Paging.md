	Paging is a memory management scheme that allows the process memory to be non contiguous. 

# Basic Method

![[Paging 2023-05-07 02.42.38.excalidraw]]

Physical memory is broken into fixed sized blocks known as frames.
Logical memory is broken into fixed sized blocks known as pages.
Pages are loaded into frames.

>> 000000111111, we can represent it in hex also.

![[Pasted image 20230507025314.png]]
The logical address is divided into two parts
1. Page number (p)
2. Page offset (d)

Lets imagine 4 bits
2 bits for page number and 2 bits for page offset.

Lets take about frames.
0000 -> 0th byte -> first frame
	0010 -> 2nd byte -> first frame
0100 -> 8th byte -> second frame
1000 -> 16th byte -> third frame

![[Paging 2023-05-07 03.02.36.excalidraw]]

In decimal
0000 -> 0th -> first 
0100 -> 100th  -> second 
0200 -> 200th -> third 
0300 -> 300th -> fourth
1300 -> 1300th  -> fourteenth 

The page size (like the frame size) is defined by the hardware. This is typically a power of two. It makes the translation easy.

If the logical address space is $2^m$ , page size is $2^n$ 

Page number = $\frac{\text{address}}{\text{page size}}$ 
(address >> $n$) divides by $2^n$ 

Page offset = $\text{address} \mathbin{\%} \text{page size}$
(address&(page_size - 1))

>>Divide by page size for page number. The reason it is not used because it is inefficient to perform with respect to binary which just requires truncation digits.

Notice that the user process by definition is unable to access any memory that it doesn't own.

When we use paging we don't have external fragmentation.
But we do have internal fragmentation. 

![[Paging 2023-05-07 17.45.04.excalidraw]]
Process sizes are independent of page size.

If we had smaller page sizes -> we would less internal fragmentation.

![[Paging 2023-05-07 17.46.24.excalidraw]]
But if we have smaller pages -> We would need more pages.
It would lead to a larger page table -> More overhead

---

Since the OS manages the memory it should be aware about the status of each frame. This information is kept in a *frame table*. 

![[Paging 2023-05-07 17.51.22.excalidraw]]

The address we provide of the buffer would a logical address. The OS has to map it to the physical address and also map the I/O device's output to the same physical address.

![[Paging 2023-05-07 17.53.17.excalidraw]]

Suppose the I/O device is keyboard.

Os would convert this to a physical address and give it to the I/O device.

# Hardware Support

We see there is a clear separation between process view of memory and actual memory.
The user process thinks that its the only one and views the whole memory as a single space.

To join these world we need - translation hardware.

The hardware implementation of the page table in the simplest way is done by set of dedicated registers. Page table is in the register. The bottleneck becomes the size of the register. 

In modern computers, the page table is in the main memory. And a page table base register (PTBR) is used to point to the page table. Changing the page table requires only changing this PTBR. 

Now lets look how would we access an address `x`.

1. Using PTBR we find the page table in MM (1st MM access)
2. It provides us with frame number
3. We combine it with page offset and access the location in MM (2nd MM access)

Thus, we can see that memory access is slowed by a factor of 2.

The standard solution to this is build a fast lookup hardware cache, called as *translation look-aside buffer(TLB)*

## TLB

The TLB is a associative, high-speed memory.
Each entry in TLB has two parts 
1. Key  (Tag)
2. Value

We compare the item, with all the keys simultaneously. If found it is returned.
TLB is small and expensive.

1. First check with TLB If exist goto 3
2. Check page table 
3. Combine and access data


![[Pasted image 20230507180921.png]]

If page number is found in page table then it is known as *page hit.*
If page number is not found in page table then it is known as *page miss*.

Some TLBs allow entries to be *wired down*, meaning they cannot be removed from the TLB. 

### Address Space Identifier (ASIDs)
Some TLB store ASIDs in each TLB entry. An ASID uniquely identifies each process and used to provide address space protection for it.

If this is not present then we would have to flush the TLB every time we execute another process.

### Effective memory access.

# Protection

Memory protection is associated with each frame. Normally these bits are kept in the page table. 

Valid invalid bit.

# Multilevel Paging 

Lets say 
Page size = 4kb
Page table entry is of 4B
Logical address space =  4GB

>[!question]
>How many entries are there in the page table?
>>[!answer]-
>>$2^{20}$

Lets say there is a process which is of 40Kb, how many pages would it actually use?
-> 10 pages

Now, the page table still contains $2^{20}$ entries and only 10 of them are valid.

![[Paging 2023-05-08 01.34.11.excalidraw]]

>[!Question]
>What is the size of the page table?
>>[!answer]-
>>$2^{20} \times 2^{2} = 2^{22}$ 4MB  

So we can see that for a 40Kb process we would require a 4MB of page table!!.

>[!note]
>A single level page table is also known as a flat table.

## Why Multi Level paging

### We may not find contiguous space to store the page table in main memory

If we don't have 4GB contiguous space, then we can't store the page table. To store it in non-contiguous way we need hierarchical paging.

### We have seen most pages are empty
Why store the corresponding entries to the pages when they are empty?


## Another example

Page size = 8 bytes
Logical address space = 1024 bytes

We need to map the logical address of 800 to physical address.


Flat level:
![[Paging 2023-06-06 14.47.57.excalidraw]]

Multi-level

![[Paging 2023-06-06 14.52.57.excalidraw]]

$\text{Page Number} = \frac{\text{Logical address}}{\text{page size}}$
$\text{offset} = \text{Logical address} \mathbin{\%} \text{page size}$

$\text{Page Number}_2 = \frac{\text{Page Number}}{\text{page size}_2}$
$\text{offset}_2 = \text{Page Number} \mathbin{\%} \text{page size}_2$


Its very easy in binary

807 -> 11 | 00100 | 111

How many levels of page tables will be needed for address translation, given that the size of page table at any level is the size of a physical page? Draw a virtual address showing the numbers of bits for the page table index at each level and the page offset.
