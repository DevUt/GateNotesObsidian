# Types of Logic

1. Propositional Logic
2. First Order logic
3. .. Other like Fuzzy logic

# Propositional Logic

- It is a world of true or false

### A proposition is ..
- It is a declarative sentence
- Either true OR false _**NOT**_ Both

Examples of a proposition 

- Jaipur is a city
- Jaipur is the capital of India
- $2 \cdot 2 = 5$
- I am a champion

### What is not a proposition
- Imperative sentences
- Questions
- Paradoxes
- Statements having Free Variables

#####  Why Questions?
Well a question is not a statement on which can assign a "True" or "False" value
For e.g 
> What did you eat for Dinner?

This question cannot be answered with a simple true or false, hence not a proposition.

##### Why Imperative Sentences?
> Go clean my poop.

It's not true or false. Its an order.

##### Paradox?
Lets define
$$\boxed{S\;=\;\boxed{\text{S is false}}}$$
Now lets consider the Outer box,
If that is true, means the inner box should be true (equality)
But the inner box says $S$ is false => Paradox.

##### Free Variables? 
$$2n = 4n + 3$$ This is true for just for 1 single value of $n$. A proposition should inherently hold true or false. 
### Proposition Variables

- Each proposition is denoted by a variable
1. Jaipur is a city -> $p$
2. Is jeevan me nahi hoga -> $q$
We can combine variables to denote lot of  scenario.
